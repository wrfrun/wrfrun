.. note::
   I'm still working on to complete ``wrfrun``'s documentation, you'll find some empty pages, which is normal :)

   I hope you like my work.

What is wrfrun?
***************

``wrfrun`` is a comprehensive toolkit for managing and using WRF. ``wrfrun`` wraps the WRF model so that the user only needs to call the corresponding Python function to run the corresponding part of the model. ``wrfrun`` avoids cluttering up the user's working directory with a lot of useless files by creating a temporary directory in which the WRF model would be run. ``wrfrun`` automatically saves mode configurations and wrfrun configurations, which makes it easier to manage the simulation and reproduction of different cases. ``wrfrun`` also provides more features through extensions, which help users to do related research better.
