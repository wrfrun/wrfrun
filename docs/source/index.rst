   I'm still working on to complete ``wrfrun``'s documentation, you'll find some empty pages, which is normal :)

   I hope you like my work.

What is wrfrun?
***************

``wrfrun`` is a comprehensive toolkit for managing and using WRF. ``wrfrun`` wraps the WRF model so that the user only needs to call the corresponding Python function to run the corresponding part of the model. ``wrfrun`` avoids cluttering up the user's working directory with a lot of useless files by creating a temporary directory in which the WRF model would be run. ``wrfrun`` automatically saves mode configurations and wrfrun configurations, which makes it easier to manage the simulation and reproduction of different cases. ``wrfrun`` also provides more features through extensions, which help users to do related research better.

Main features
*************

* Provide Python functions with the same names as WRF executables.
* Isolate the entire simulation in a temporary directory, avoid messing up your project directory.
* Automatically save all configurations (including ``wrfrun`` config file and namelist files) after completing simulation.
* Record your simulation progress, export simulation configurations and data to a ``.replay`` file.
* Replay simulations based on your provided ``.replay`` file.
