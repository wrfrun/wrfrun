# ðŸŒ€ wrfrun

> A modern, unified framework for running and managing numerical models.
>
> Designed for researchers who want to focus on science â€” not on the details of model execution.

## ðŸ“– Introduction

`wrfrun` is a Python package that provides a general-purpose, reproducible, and extensible framework for running numerical models.

It automates the tedious parts of model execution â€” preparing input data, handling `namelist` configurations, organizing logs, and submitting jobs â€” so that you can spend your time on research, not on managing model runs.

## ðŸŒŸ Core Features

### ðŸ§© Unified Interface Architecture

`wrfrun` enforces a unified interface specification for all numerical models. Specifically, each model interface must inherit from a provided base class, ensuring a consistent structure and behavior across different models.

This design makes model execution intuitive â€” any supported model can be launched simply by calling a Python function or class method, while `wrfrun` automatically handles all background tasks such as data preparation and configuration file management.

```python
from wrfrun import WRFRun
from wrfrun.model.wrf import geogrid, metgrid, real, ungrib, wrf

# wrfrun will prepare input data, generate namelist file, 
# save outputs and logs automatically.
with WRFRun("./config.toml", init_workspace=True) as wrf_run:
    geogrid()
    ungrib()
    metgrid()
    real()
    wrf()
```



# wrfrun: A toolkit to control WRF

##  What is wrfrunï¼Ÿ

Using and managing WRF can be a tedious task. WRF's configuration file contains a large number of settings, which generally need to be configured separately for each simulation case, and the user usually needs to rely on other tools or scripts to manage the simulation of different cases, which causes a lot of inconvenience. In addition, the whole process of running the WRF model involves running many programs, which is very time-consuming to run manually and requires the use of scripts to automate certain processes.

`wrfrun` is a comprehensive toolkit for managing and using WRF. `wrfrun` wraps the WRF model so that the user only needs to call the corresponding Python function to run the corresponding part of the model. `wrfrun` avoids cluttering up the user's working directory with a lot of useless files by creating a temporary directory in which the WRF model would be run. `wrfrun` automatically saves mode configurations and wrfrun configurations, which makes it easier to manage the simulation and reproduction of different cases. `wrfrun` also provides more features through extensions, which help users to do related research better.

## Main Features

The following are the main features that wrfrun wants to achieve. These features have been basically realized, and are still under continuous improvement.

- Isolate the WRF runtime directory in a separate temporary directory.
- Automatic saving of mode output, logs and configurations.
- Provide an interface to run any part of the WRF model.
- Real-time parsing of WRF logs, feedback on simulation progress.
- Support for adding more functionality through extensions.

## Dependencies

You need to install `meson` and `ninja` at first, both of which can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install meson ninja
```

Make sure the path `$HOME/.local/bin` has been added to your environment variable `PATH`.

## Installation

Install using pip:

```bash
pip install wrfrun
```
